## Problem Statment
This project is designed by taking Amazon Prime-like websites as a base. In Amazon Prime User will be subscribed with some amount for some fixed duration, with that amount the user can access the videos like web series, movies etc. But if the user didn’t watch during that duration then his subscription amount will be wasted and after that duration he can’t watch any videos, so again the user should subscribe with some amount to continue to watch.
