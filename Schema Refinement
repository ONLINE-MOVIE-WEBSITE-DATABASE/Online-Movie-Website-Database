## ADMIN Table:
Attributes are: Aid, Aname ,Category, Time
Primary Key/Key Attributes: Aid
Non key attributes: Aname, Category, Time
Functional dependencies are :
Aid->Aname
Aid->Category
Category -> Time
1NF: All the attributes in the Admin table are single valued attributes so, we can say Admin table is in INF.
2NF: Above FD’s are mapping from key attribute to non key attribute and there is no partial dependency (A non key attribute depends on part of a primary key), so we can say Admin table is in 2NF.
3NF: Category depends on Aid and Time depends on category. Which is a transitive dependency As there is a transitive dependency table is not in 3NF. 
To make it into 3NF we perform decomposition on the Admin Table.
Admin (Aid, Aname, Category, Time) decomposed into 
Admin1 (Aid, Aname, Category) and   Admin2(Category, Time)
As there is no transitive dependencies in the new tables formed 
Therefore, Admin table is in 3NF.

## Movie List Table:

Primary Key/Key Attributes: Mid
Non key attributes: MNAME, LANGUAGE, RATING
Functional dependencies are:
Mid->Mname
Mid->Language
Mid-> Rating
1NF: All the attributes in the MovieList table are single valued attributes so, we can say MovieList table is in INF.
2NF:Above FD’s are mapping from key attribute to non key attribute and there is no partial dependency(A non key attribute depends on part of a primary key), so we can say MovieList table is in 2NF.
3NF: From above FD’S we can observe that there is no transitive dependency so, we can say that the MovieList table is in 3NF.

## Collect Table:
Attributes: Aid, Mid, DOC
Primary Key/Key Attributes: Aid,Mid
Non key attributes: Doc
Functional dependencies are:
Aid,Mid -> Doc
1NF: All the attributes in the Collect table are single valued attributes so, we can say Collect table is in INF.
2NF: Above FD’s are mapping from key attribute to non key attribute and there is no partial dependency (A non key attribute depends on part of a primary key), so we can say Collect table is in 2NF.
3NF: From above FD’S we can observe that there is no transitive dependency so, we can say that the Collect table is in 3NF.

## Distributor Table:
Attributes are: DID,DNA$%%%%ME ,PRICE,MID ,STATUS ,DOR 
Primary Key/Key Attributes: MID
Non key attributes: DNAME, PRICE, DID, STATUS, DOR 
Functional dependencies are:
Did -> DName
Did-> Mid
Mid-> Status
Mid-> DOR
Mid->Price
1NF: All the attributes in the Distributor table are single valued attributes so, we can say, the Distributor table is in INF.
2NF: Above FD’s are mapping from key attribute to non key attribute and there is no partial dependency (A non key attribute depends on part of a primary key), so we can say Collect table is in 2NF.
3NF: From above FD’S we can observe that Mid depends on Did, Status depends on Mid, DOR depends on Mid, Price depends on Mid, Which is a transitive dependency.
As there is a transitive dependency table is not in 3NF. To make it into 3NF we perform decomposition on the Distributor Table.It is decomposed as:
Distributor (Did, Dname, Mid, Status, Price) decomposed into 
Distributor 1(Did, Dname, Mid) and   Distributor 2(Mid, Status, DOR, Price)
As there is no transitive dependencies in the new tables formed 
Therefore, Distributor table is in 3NF

## Purchase Table:
Attributes are: PID, AID, MID, DOP
Primary Key/Key Attributes are: PID
Non Key Attributes are: AID, MID, DOP
Functional dependencies are:
Pid -> Aid
Pid -> Mid
Pid-> DOP
1NF: All the attributes in the Purchase table are single valued attributes so, we can say, the Purchase table is in INF.
2NF: Above FD’s are mapping from key attribute to non key attribute and there is no partial dependency (A non key attribute depends on part of a primary key), so we can say Purchase table is in 2NF.
3NF: From above FD’S we can observe that there is no transitive dependency so, we can say that the Purchase table is in 3NF.

## Movie Table:
Attributes are: M_ID, MNAME, LANGUAGE,DURATION 
Primary Key/Key Attributes are: M_ID
Non Key Attributes are: MNAME, LANGUAGE,DURATION 
Functional dependencies are:
Mid -> MNAME
Mid -> LANGUAGE
Mid -> DURATION
1NF:  All the attributes in the Movie table are single valued attributes so, we can say, the Movie table is in INF.
2NF: Above FD’s are mapping from key attribute to non key attribute and there is no partial dependency (A non key attribute depends on part of a primary key), so we can say Purchase table is in 2NF.
3NF: From above FD’S we can observe that there is no transitive dependency so, we can say that the Movie table is in 3NF.

## Release Table:
Attributes are: PID,M_ID,PRICE,DOR
Primary Key/Key Attributes are: PID
Non Key Attributes are: M_ID, PRICE, DOR
Functional dependencies are:
PID -> DOR
PID -> PRICE
1NF: All the attributes in the Release table are single valued attributes so, we can say, the Release table is in INF.
2NF: Above FD’s are mapping from key attribute to non key attribute and there is no partial dependency (A non key attribute depends on part of a primary key), so we can say Releases table is in 2NF.
3NF: From above FD’S we can observe that there is no transitive dependency so, we can say that the Releases table is in 3NF.

## CUSTOMER Table:
